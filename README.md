JavaScript Challenge

In this project, the goal was to perform an automatic table and date search on Level One and to perform a multiple search category search on Level Two. 

On Level One, using the UFO dataset provided in array format of Javscript objects, code had to be written that appends a table into a web page and then have the ability to add new rrows of data for each UFO. The task was to include a column for date/time, city, state, country, shape, and comment at a minimum.  Additionally, the project task should include a date form in the HTML document and a written JavaScript code that would listen for events and search through the date/time column to find rows that match user input.

On Level Two, the project task was to set up a webpage to perform multiple search categories after completing the previously mentioned Level One criteria.  While using multiple input tags and dropdowns, a JavaScrip code was written to include multiple filters that could search UFO sightings using the table column criteria of the following: 
•	date/time
•	city
•	state
•	country
•	shape

In closing, this project allowed me to learn more about webpage development.  My biggest takeaway was trying to build the webpage and meet the task as mentioned in the instructions and make it searchable.  Thanks.
